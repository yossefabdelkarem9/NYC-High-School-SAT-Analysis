# NYC High School SAT Analysis 🎓

Welcome to my project repository!

This project is part of my personal data analysis learning journey. It explores SAT scores of high schools in New York City, aiming to uncover patterns and relationships using Python and data visualization tools.

📁 **Project Files**
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data analysis and visualizations  
- `schools.csv`: The dataset of NYC high school SAT scores and demographics  
- `schoolbus.jpg`: An image used for project illustration  
- `README.md`: This project summary file  

📌 **Key Concepts Applied**
- Data cleaning and preparation with `pandas`  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Grouping and merging datasets  
- Statistical summary and correlation analysis  
- Data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

🎯 **Project Summary**
The analysis investigates SAT performance across NYC high schools, focusing on:

- Trends between SAT scores and school demographics  
- Comparing SAT scores by borough  
- Correlation between SAT scores and factors like enrollment or safety  
- Data insights through clear graphs and metrics  

🚀 **Outcome**
Through this project, I:

- Applied real-world data analysis techniques in Python  
- Strengthened my EDA, visualization, and storytelling skills  
- Gained insights into education data from a public dataset  

Thanks for visiting!
