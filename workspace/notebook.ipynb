There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import pandas as pd\n\n# Load the dataset\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the first few rows\nprint(schools.head())\n\n# Drop rows with missing SAT score data\nschools.dropna(subset=['average_math', 'average_reading', 'average_writing'], inplace=True)\n\n# Filter schools with math score >= 640 (80% of 800)\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools['average_math'] >= 640][['school_name', 'average_math']]\nbest_math_schools = best_math_schools.sort_values(by='average_math', ascending=False)\n\n# Calculate total SAT score\nschools['total_SAT'] = (\n    schools['average_math'] +\n    schools['average_reading'] +\n    schools['average_writing']\n)\n\n# Get top 10 schools by total SAT score\ntop_10_schools = schools[['school_name', 'total_SAT']].sort_values(by='total_SAT', ascending=False).head(10)\n\n# Calculate stats per borough\nborough_stats = schools.groupby('borough').agg(\n    num_schools=('school_name', 'count'),\n    average_SAT=('total_SAT', 'mean'),\n    std_SAT=('total_SAT', 'std')\n).reset_index()\n\n# Round the numeric values to 2 decimal places\nborough_stats[['average_SAT', 'std_SAT']] = borough_stats[['average_SAT', 'std_SAT']].round(2)\n\n# Select the borough with the highest SAT score standard deviation\nlargest_std_dev = borough_stats.sort_values(by='std_SAT', ascending=False).head(1)\n\n# Print best math schools\nprint(best_math_schools)\n\n# Print top 10 SAT schools\nprint(top_10_schools)\n\n# Print the borough with the largest score variation\nprint(largest_std_dev)\n","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":56,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"import pandas as pd\n\n# Load the dataset\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the first few rows\nprint(schools.head())\n\n# Drop rows with missing SAT score data\nschools.dropna(subset=['average_math', 'average_reading', 'average_writing'], inplace=True)\n\n# Filter schools with math score >= 640 (80% of 800)\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools['average_math'] >= 640][['school_name', 'average_math']]\nbest_math_schools = best_math_schools.sort_values(by='average_math', ascending=False)\n\n# Calculate total SAT score\nschools['total_SAT'] = (\n    schools['average_math'] +\n    schools['average_reading'] +\n    schools['average_writing']\n)\n\n# Get top 10 schools by total SAT score\ntop_10_schools = schools[['school_name', 'total_SAT']].sort_values(by='total_SAT', ascending=False).head(10)\n\n# Calculate stats per borough\nborough_stats = schools.groupby('borough').agg(\n    num_schools=('school_name', 'count'),\n    average_SAT=('total_SAT', 'mean'),\n    std_SAT=('total_SAT', 'std')\n).reset_index()\n\n# Round the numeric values to 2 decimal places\nborough_stats[['average_SAT', 'std_SAT']] = borough_stats[['average_SAT', 'std_SAT']].round(2)\n\n# Select the borough with the highest SAT score standard deviation\nlargest_std_dev = borough_stats.sort_values(by='std_SAT', ascending=False).head(1)\n\n# Print best math schools\nprint(best_math_schools)\n\n# Print top 10 SAT schools\nprint(top_10_schools)\n\n# Print the borough with the largest score variation\nprint(largest_std_dev)\n","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1754287270681,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":555,"type":"stream"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"086ade0e-3652-4948-a9c1-1e0fd26f5f1b"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"                                         school_name  ... percent_tested\n0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...  ...
